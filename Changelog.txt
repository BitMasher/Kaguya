Version 2.0

- Complete rewrite of the Kaguya application from scratch.
- Data is stored in a MySQL database instead of JSON storage. This is necessary for 
    data reliability, scalability, backups, and, most importantly, speed.
- Complete rewrite of the Kaguya Supporter system. This new system introduces a server and user 
    specific premium service. When a user purchases a supporter tag for themselves, they will be 
    able to give any server they want a proportional amount of 'premium' status. For every 30-days 
    of supporter a user buys, they will receive one "premium token." This token will be able 
    to be redeemed simply by typing a command inside of the server they want to redeem the token in.
- Both user and server premium options offer *lots* of practical tools and advantages, such as a 
    detailed moderation log logging warns, unwarns, mutes, unmutes, shadowbans, and unshadowbans 
    all with one logtype.
- Significantly more polished command responses across the board.
