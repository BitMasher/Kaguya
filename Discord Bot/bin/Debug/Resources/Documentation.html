    <h1>StageBot Documentation</h1>
    <h3>Welcome to the StageBot Documentation!
        This document will teach you everything you need to know about how to use the bot.</h3>

    <h2>So, what is StageBot?</h2>
    <p>StageBot is a Discord Bot currently in development that is designed to be an "all-in-one"
        solution for any Discord need! Final features will include:
        <ul>
            <li>osu! Related commands/functions</li>
            <li>Vast administration and utility commands</li>
            <li>Currency and experience point ecosystem</li>
            <li>Later versions will include YouTube music playback, with the possibility of more music streaming services being added</li>
            <li>Minigames</li>
            <li>Ability for self-hosters to modify currency and experience point system to their liking</li>
            <li>Global and local leaderboard for currencies and experience points</li>
            <li>Detaield explanation of all commands and functions</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Okay that's great, what's this self-hosting thing though?</h2>
    <p>Self hosting is the act of downloading a precompiled version of StageBot from <a href="https://github.com/stageosu/StageBot">GitHub</a>
    and setting things up using your own bot's token. It's easier than it sounds, it just requires some basic knowledge of 
    Discord's API. Self-hosters must also know that the bot will be run from their own computer/web server instead of the public
    version of StageBot. If you want 24/7 uptime, you will need to host the bot on a spare computer that's running constantly, or
    a remote desktop/server of some sort. I personally recommend using Amazon AWS.</p>

    <h2>Why would I want to self-host?</h2>
    <p>Self hosting unlocks the ability to manage your own server's experience point system and currency ecosystem, 
        one that is completely unique to you and separate from the official version of StageBot. The only drawback 
        to using your own ecosystem is that it is very isolated compared to the much larger, public StageBot ecosystem.
    </p>

    <h1>Section 1.0: Public StageBot</h1>
    <h3>Section 1.1: Getting Started</h3>
    <p>So you like what you've heard so far? Let's go ahead and get StageBot inside of your server.</p>
    <p>You will need to be an Administrator of the server you wish to add the bot into in order 
        for this to work. <b>To add the bot to a server, <a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=538910393918160916&scope=bot&permissions=8">click this link.</a></b>
        You will be redirected to a page that grants you an option to add StageBot into a server. Select your server and authorize.
        At this point, the bot should now be in your server. Hooray!
    </p>
    <h3>Section 1.2: Get familiar with the bot</h3>
    <p>For this next step, all I would really recommend you do is read through the $help command
        and then type $modules to become familiar with all of StageBot's modules and commands (there will be a lot in later versions!).
        StageBot is a very powerful tool, so make sure you know how to use it. You can also teach the administration commands to your 
        server moderators/administrators.
    </p>
    <h3>Section 1.3: Commands</h3>
    <p>Full list will come later, for now just type "$h (command)" to get more information on a specific command.</p>
