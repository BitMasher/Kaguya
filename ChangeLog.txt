Welcome to the Kaguya ChangeLog.


Changelog:

Version 1.13

- Removed a 3 second delay I had with $clear that was there for no reason...clearing of messages should happen a lot faster now.
- "MessageEdits" logtype has been renamed to "UpdatedMessages"

Version 1.12.1

- Removed $cmds and $mdls from help command (this was causing a LOT of confusion srryy!!!!)

Verison 1.12

- Added $toggleannouncements to the utility module
- Added a help command for $toggleannouncements
- Fixed a small formatting issue with $h (mute wasn't separated)
- $help has been completely re-written. You can now scroll through the command list with emojis (reactions) and the format is different. Try it out!
- $commands and $modules have been removed as they have basically been merged into the $h command.

Version 1.11.1

- Fixed a bug where $echo wasn't working.
- $echo no longer has a title in the embed.

Version 1.11

- $n command has been given a new dedicated source of lewds. 110 new drawings (however featuring similar characters) have been added!
    - This is exclusive for $n on its own, and does not affect any tags or $n bomb.
- Fixed a bug where it was impossible to get a "100" roll with $gr

- Cleaned up some code in osuGeneral.cs
- $gr multipliers have been slightly reduced.
- critical multiplier for a 100 roll has been set to 5.00 * 6.00 (30x)

    - New feature: Paginated lists! Starting with $inrole, you can now use reactions to scroll through certain command lists.
        - I plan to add this in with help commands soon!


Version 1.10.2

- Removed the server message log verifications because it was super buggy.

Version 1.10.1

- Removed (secret) sttreflog command (it is no longer needed).
- Music commands prefix is now "m" (was "p"). Mute no longer has an alias of "m".
- $m skip responses edited.
- Modified EmbedHandler ~ Can now have a footer as an optional parameter, allowing much easier addition of footers.
    - Saves code space too this way ^_^
- Automatic Bug Report feature added. If an exception is thrown in code, sometimes an automatic bug report will be created if it is important. This allows
    me to fix things without a user having to report the bug.
- If an unknown exception is thrown with the leveling system, it will now be sent in chat and an automatic bug report will be created.
- Cleaned up some code regarding embed message sending.
- ConsoleCriticalAdvisories will now also display the stack trace of the exception that occurred.
- Some error messages that did not appear with a title now will. (18 errors!)
- Attempted to fix a bug where the music player will throw an error if it can't load a query that isn't there. (null request)
- If a song fails to load, Kaguya will now throw an error in chat.
- Fixed a bug with $m resume where it would actually attempt to keep pausing even if it was paused instead of resume.
- Added in-code documentation for EmbedHandler (function summaries, etc.)
- Removed a lot of unnecessary "usings" from several different classes.
- Fixed a bug where the $m queue would display the "Up Next" song in the queue as #2 and #3.
- Fixed a small bug with $m skip where if there was only one song in the queue it wouldn't skip it. Now, it stops and only throws an error if there are no songs in the queue at all.
- Fixed a bug where, on every sent message, the bot was CONSTANTLY overwriting a user's username in the UserAccounts file. Should significantly improve performance.
- Level-ups now will occur slightly more frequently. The xp:level curve was (and may still be) too harsh. All levels will automatically be updated.
- On startup, Kaguya will now verify all server message logs. If she's not connected to a guild that has a log, she will now delete that log. In addition,
    she will now update the server names of all servers in the log.
- Cleaned up a lot of code and removed ~10 unused variables.
- Removed RedCell diagnostic thing in properties because I removed it a long time ago and it kept a really annoying warning hanging around.

- $hug, kiss, tickle, poke, and pat commands have been added :)

- Patched a loophole that allowed echoed messages with filtered phrases in them to pass through and be sent. Now, the bot will delete both the message and the echoed message immediately.
- Added the $mute command! This is a very, very powerful mute command. Use $h mute for more information!
- Fixed a bug with $addpoints ~ the user would be mentioned not the target.

- Leveling embed is now more compact, takes up less space in chat.

- **Fixed a major bug with the word filter. If a message contains a filtered phrase, it will now be deleted properly. Resolves #23!**
- Took out the ability for the bot to log messages to it's own file (commandmessagelogs.txt). This will likely eliminate (potential) crashes.
    Kaguya would throw an unhandled exception if high rates of use were achieved.
- Fixed a bug with "$deleterole" where if multiple roles of the same name were found, the bot would not do anything.
    Now, Kaguya will delete all roles with the matched name.
- Updated "$DeleteTextChannel" and "$DeleteVoiceChannel" commands to properly delete the channels.
    Channels can now be mentioned (#<Channel>) or just the name of the channel will do.

    deleted channel, even if the channel didn't exist in the first place.

    This applies for phrases including spaces as well.
- $filterremove [fr] added.
- $filterview [fv] added.
- $filterclear [clearfilter] added.
- $clear with no parameters now defaults to deleting 10 messages instead of 25.
- $setlogchannel / $log added. Sets the specified channel to be where the bot logs information.
- $resetlogchannel / $rlog added. Resets all log channels and disables logging (per log event -- $rlog all disables logging for the whole guild.)
- Updated $clear command so that it properly deletes the specified number of messages.
- New database file for cached server messages (this is required for proper logging).
- $awardeveryone / $awardall (new bot owner command).
- Fixed a bug with `$cmds utility` that prevented it from working.
- $g/$gamble has been renamed to $gr/$groll (all point gambling commands will start with g as of this patch.)
- $masspointsdistribute command added. This allows any user to evenly distribute all of their Kaguya points to everyone in the server.

- Kaguya now sends a helpful message to the server owner upon joining a new guild.
- $massban now has a help command.

Version 1.4.2.1

- Fixed a bug where $osutop's title link would give 404 errors. Closes #10
- Tweaked $osutop to now have the chosen user's proper name instead of the name specified when executing the command.
    By this I mean the displayed username will have the same capitalization as what is shown on the official osu! website,
    instead of the capitalization chosen when executing the command. If someone's $osuset name has different capitalization
    than what is on the website, it won't matter anymore. Closes #8
- Fixed a bug where deleterole wouldn't do anything if two roles have the same name. 
    Bot now deletes the first role it finds with the specified name. Closes #14
