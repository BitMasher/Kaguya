### Kaguya Bot Project (Created by Stage)

The Kaguya Project is a general purpose chatbot for the very popular VoIP communications platform [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). Kaguya handles many complex tasks, including server bot-raid prevention, and has always had the goal of making server administrator's lives easier. The second goal of the Kaguya Project is to provide the most powerful and dynamic administration and utility tools that Discord has ever seen, all packed in an **easy to use** program. This includes 20+ independent logtypes (which are automatic updates posted to a specific channel upon configuration, such as when a user is banned).

### Version 2.0

Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite of the existing program, from the ground up. Version 2.0 is a completely new bot while still maintaining the same features people are familiar with, they are just now improved upon. Version 2.0 also features a new user **and** server supporter system, where many various perks are unlocked for each at a relatively low cost. Here's a highlight reel of what is to come with V2.0.
