### Kaguya Bot Project (Created by Stage)

The Kaguya Project is a general purpose chatbot for the very popular VoIP communications platform [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). Kaguya handles many complex tasks, including server bot-raid prevention, and has always had the goal of making server administrator's lives easier. The second goal of the Kaguya Project is to provide the most powerful and dynamic administration and utility tools that Discord has ever seen, all packed in an **easy to use** program. This includes 20+ independent logtypes (which are automatic updates posted to a specific channel upon configuration, such as when a user is banned).

### Version 2.0

Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite of the existing program, from the ground up. Version 2.0 is a completely new bot while still maintaining the same features people are familiar with, they are just now improved upon. Version 2.0 also features a new user **and** server supporter system, where many various perks are unlocked for each at a relatively low cost. Here's a highlight reel of what is to come with V2.0.

- Complete rewrite of the current program, resulting in astronomically more scalability and efficiency (something I didn't take into account with V1). The estimated gained efficiency is about 1,200%.
- [Premium] A moderation log (no configuration required) that records various server actions, including [warnings](https://i.imgur.com/nIPz8Mk.png)
- New database structure that allows for infinite scalability (was previously using strictly JSON files).
- Browser-based web application that allows users and server admins to log-in via Discord and view stats about them/their server. More functionality will be reserved for premium servers, and users with a [Kaguya Supporter](https://stageosu.selly.store/) tag are granted Alpha access to the program. Server admins will be able to view exceptionally more stats about their server via this app, and will even be able to remotely control certain configurations (such as logging, twitch/youtube notifications, view moderation logs, etc.) I plan that this app will contain significantly more functionality than MEE6's, although it may not look as pretty for a while.
- Improvement of the $help command for all commands, it's now much more helpful.
- Improvements of literally every single command in the bot.
- All logtypes now contain significantly more information than they used to.
- MyAnimeList integration
- Twitch, YouTube, Twitter[$], Reddit[$] integrations.
- Dynamic DM reminders with $remindme (something that failed in V1 due to how inefficient it was)
- Server-based EXP and level systems, which unlocks for things like role rewards to be granted to users who reach a certain server level. Everyone will start at server level 0, however.

### Self Hosting
With V2, it is much easier to clone the bot and run with your own token (with my help), however I would like for users to notify me if they decide to do this. **I will not provide any support for users who wish to self-host using my code, and I do not condone it.** I will only provide support for users who want to support the development of the program. It is basically impossible to run this bot without my support, as you would need to create an entire database schema with many tables, configured exactly correct, just to get this bot to not crash. You cannot use this bot without a database. I will provide a script file that auto-creates the database for you if you wish to support development.
