# [Kaguya](https://top.gg/bot/538910393918160916)
## Your all in one Discord Bot.

The Kaguya Discord Bot provides the pinnacle of what a general-purpose Discord bot can offer. Recently rewritten from the ground up, Kaguya strikes a perfect balance between ease of use and power.

## Main Featues:
* Anti-Raid features to protect your server!
    - Protects your server from mass raids by allowing Administrators to configure whether to action a 
    certain amount of users who join within a specified time limit.
    - Example: `$antiraid 5 20 ban` - Bans 5 (or more) users if they join within 20 seconds of eachother.
* **FREE** Level Up Role Rewards
    - Allows Server Administrators to configure a role to be given when a user reaches a certain server level.
* Powerful logging features.
    - Kaguya can log:
    	- User banned/unbanned
        - User joined/left
        - Filtered phrase detected
        - User connected to/disconnected from/changed voice channel
        - Server/global/fishing level announcements
        - Antiraid events with who was actioned
        - Greetings
    - and MORE!
* Powerful moderation features.
    - Kaguya can:
        - Take action on a user who has been warned more than once.
        - Word and Phrase filtering
        - Create / Delete / Assign roles all without having to go into server settings. Just one command and you can make a new role.
        - Delete Unused Roles.
        - HyperBans: Permanently bans a user from this server and from **any other server that the command executor is an Administrator in.** *Kaguya must be present in all mutual servers for this to work properly.* (Use this command with caution)
        - Shadow bans
    - and more!
* Super fun and addicting fishing game, as well as other games! (First person to catch a **Legendary Big Kahuna** and DM a screenshot to `mmatt#0001` will get 1 month of Discord Nitro! **Not Claimed Yet** [Offer expires 1/1/2021])
* Fun economy system (With global and server specific levels.)
